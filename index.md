ADA525

A floating buoy that measures wave height.

Purpose and idea behind the floating buoy:

Due to the effects of climate change, the majority of coastal regions have begun experiencing rapid changes
causing devastating effects on their surrounding environments. Erratic changes in temperature, wind velocity
and precipitation disrupt the oceanic currents in a way that negatively affects the natural habitat of oceanic
life forms as well as human activities (e.g fishing, tourist attractions, etc) that generate income.
