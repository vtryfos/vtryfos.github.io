# **CAD model of the floating buoy.**

## **CAD process:**
As stated in the previous section, the CAD model of the floating buoy is being designed using the Fusion360 software program. The final design of the buoy is slightly different compared to the one that we saw in the previous section. The buoy is composed of two hollow  semi-spheres that will be fastened together using ten sets of screws and nuts (Fig1).

To make the interior of the buoy waterproof, I created in total 4 ring torus along the outer edges of both semi-spheres as depicted in Figure 2, where two rubber O-rings sealing gaskets will be placed inside the ring torus to achieve that. In addition, a small window is also shaped in the upper semi-sphere. This feature will help me to inspect the interior of the main body for any potential leaks.

One more important feature to note is the creation of a flat base located inside the lower semi-sphere will be the base that accommodates the measuring instruments, as shown in figure 3.

The final step in completing the design of the buoy is the inside tower that will accommodate and hold tight in place all the instruments needed to complete the project. This tower is yet to be designed as the dimensions of the instrument are still unknown. This arises from not yet knowing the specific models that will be used. Lastly, figure 4 shows the final form of the floating buoy.

## **External components:**
The floating buoy will gather information about the wave height. To achieve this, special instruments need to be placed inside the buoys housing. The system will need an arduino, a 3-axis accelerometer, a 5-7 volts battery, and cable connections to wire the accelerator to the arduino. 

The buoy and its instruments require power from a 5-7 volts battery. A potential solution to make the buoy self-sufficient is the integration of a pendulum within the buoy. I expect the pendulum will rotate in response to the disruptive waves crashing against the buoy. Lasty, I will also install a tachometer to check whether the pendulum rotations can potentially create a sufficient number of rotations per minute (RPM) to charge the battery that powers up the system.
