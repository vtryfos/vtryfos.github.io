# **CAD model of the floating buoy.**


## **CAD process:**
As stated in the previous section, the CAD model of the floating buoy is being designed using the Fusion360 software program. The final design of the buoy is slightly different compared to the one that we saw in the previous section. The buoy is composed of two hollow  semi-spheres that will be fastened together using ten sets of screws and nuts (Fig1).

To make the interior of the buoy waterproof, I created in total 4 ring torus along the outer edges of both semi-spheres as depicted in Figure 2, where two rubber O-rings sealing gaskets will be placed inside the ring torus to achieve that. In addition, a small window is also shaped in the upper semi-sphere. This feature will help me to inspect the interior of the main body for any potential leaks.
