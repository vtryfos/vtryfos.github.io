# **Digital Fabrication Recitation**


## **Introduction**
During the last few weeks, we encountered, went through, and learned some basic digital fabrication techniques. This technology has changed the design, production, and construction of objects using a different set of materials and tools (Hnin, 2023). According to Hnin (2023), digital fabrication can be divided into two categories: the additive and the subtractive manufacturing. In order to use the computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) to its potential, we need initially to create a model using a computer-aided design software (CAD), such as the Fusion360 software (Velling, 2021). The latter will be translated into something a laser cutting machine (subtractive) or a 3D printer (additive) can handle and create a product (Velling, 2021). More specifically, in this essay, I will mention the capabilities and the digital-physical relationship of the digital fabrication technology. In addition, I will provide a practical example of differentiation between my digital model and the fabricated result. Furthermore, I will try to assert the limitations of digital design and how I attempted to solve any countered problems using this technology and lastly, I will reflect on my experience using this technology.

## **Capabilities of the technology**
The introduction of digital fabrication revolutionized the way people used to design blueprints  and create physical objects. This technology is characterized by a computer-automated process, with little human input, which makes the whole process fast and precise. In fact, the speed and precision of the process formulate the primary capability of digital fabrication, namely, its efficiency and reliability (Hnin, 2022). The latter two, allow a designer to swiftly produce a prototype by either 3D printing it or laser cutting it. Another important aspect of the technology’s capabilities is its waste reduction, as the efficiency and reliability of the technology limits significantly design errors that would normally occur in manual machining (Velling, 2021). Another capability of digital fabrication is its substantial control over the manufacturing process. That control combined by a perfect CAD design can result in an easily repeatable process which promotes large-scale production, cost efficiency and fast output of a product towards the market  (Velling, 2021). The digital fabrication’s progress does not remain stationary, it continuously evolves to meet the needs of modern design projects and manufacturing (Justice, 2023). 

## **Digital-physical relationship**
The digital-physical relationship in digital fabrication is a rather complex relationship that requires taking into consideration the physical properties of a material when working (or designing) a project. In other words, it is responsible to pick the appropriate material of the physical product while this product is designed. For example, it is not a very good idea to laser cut and produce door hinges made out of low-quality plywood, as this material is not capable of withstanding a door's weight and applied stress. More specifically, designing something using CAD software does not mean that the physical product manufactured by a CAM process will be exactly the same and fit the purpose of the build.

Another important thing that was pointed out early during the ADA525 course is the conditions around the actual 3D printing process. In this case, it is important to avoid having the 3D printer close to an open window or even a door, as the breeze would impact the 3D product's temperature, affecting the product's structural integrity. Additionally, it is vital to apply adhesive on the 3D printer's thermal plate to ensure a smooth start of the printing process, resulting in a desired product.

Lastly, it is essential to have the ability to choose the appropriate manufacturing technique when creating a physical product. In the case where the final physical product would be a flat, rectangular surface, it would be appropriate to choose the time-efficient laser cutting method. On the other hand, the 3D printing option would be ideal if the physical product's shape was more dynamic, with a higher degree of geometrical complexity, e.g., a piston or a gearwheel.

## **Practical example of deviation**
The only thing worthy of discussion is the appearance of my project. During the product's design in the CAD software, its surface looked tidy and smooth. After 3D printing the product, its surface was wavy and rough. The primary and only reason for that is actually the 3D printer's 'resolution', or in other words, the thickness of the melted PLA plastic coming out of the nozzle. In my case, the deviation of my physical product from the digital one was only cosmetic and relatively easy to remove with a bit of sanding; however, other significant problems may appear in other cases if the user does not take into consideration the analyzed points during the paragraph above.  

## **Limitations of digital design**
The design process of the product, as well as its production, typically takes place in a digital environment since the usage of two computer-aided tools is a necessity. This brings forward some limitations which make the whole digital fabrication experience somewhat tricky. The first limitation to note is the complexity of the computer-aided design and manufacturing setups, meaning that the user needs to be skilled and have a good understanding of how those setups work (Velling, 2021). However, new users do not possess the aforementioned knowledge about those setups, making the whole experience challenging to master from the very beginning (Velling, 2021).

Another important limitation noted is the user’s inability to make changes to the product during the manufacturing process. For example, the carpenter’s direct involvement with the product allows improvisation and minor adjustments while working on the product. In our case, we need to wait for the 3D printer to finish the product and then decide whether changes need to be implemented, which can be effectively a process where much material is unnecessarily used and spent.

## **Problem-Solving**
During the fabrication process of my project for this subject, I encountered problems that were spotted after the product design was finished. Firstly, the length and width of the designed product exceeded the 3D printer’s build capabilities. The product’s size was simply too big to be 3D printed. To fix that, I had to redesign and scale the product’s size, as the product’s complexity and components were not allowing me to just adjust its size. Another problem was the printing time needed for the build, which exceeded 7 hours at the beginning. The solution to that was to make the product’s walls thinner and reduce the build’s resolution, which reduced the product’s 3D printing time significantly. However, the product’s quality and robustness were also reduced due to those time-reducing implementations. 

## **Reflection and conclusions**
During the last few weeks, we dug into and learned about some digital fabrication techniques, from modeling a design to creating a physical product out of it. This technology provides precision, effectivity, and control over the manufacturing process and allows us to translate a thought into something physical. However, the complexity of this technology demands skilled users who understand the used material properties to manufacture a robust and reliable product at its full potential. In my case, I have been on a steep learning curve since this subject began, meaning that it is necessary to learn a great deal about this technology, which requires significant effort and focus since this whole experience is new to me. The practical problems I encountered and the solutions I implemented helped me understand how certain aspects of digital fabrication technology work.
